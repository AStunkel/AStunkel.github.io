					<p>Amalfi Coast, Italy August 2014</p>
						<p>I've done a fair bit of traveling abroad, and I've found that local stories tend to be the history of the poor. In many cases they are sad, and serve as a lesson.
						In Italy I took this picture, my friend Bartolo told me it marks the hall of a minor gentry.
						The husband died at a young age, and his wife was left with the property and wealth. She
						became attached to her steward and they began a romantic relationship that ended in a secret
						marriage. When the woman's brothers found out that she married without permission-and to her
						steward-they allegedly killed him and bricked her up in the tower to die. Bartolo said that
						there are many stories like that in Italy, ones of love and sadness. This picture was taken
						along the Amalfi Coast.</p>

						<p>According to him, the Italian Cypress has different meanings throughout Italy. In the Amalfi
						region, the Italian Cypress is usually planted around graveyards. It resembles the flame of a
						candle, burning for the dead. In northern Italy, the meaning of the Cypress is different. If
						 you look at the picture of the tower again, you can see the Cypress lining the avenue to the
						 tower...well the tops of the peaks at least.</p>

					<p>Isle of Capri</p>
						<p>This image was taken on the Isle of Capri in 2014. Two main historical towns were the town
							of Capri, and the town of AnaCapri. In this image I am standing on a balcony in AnaCapri, looking
							down on the town of Capri. The town of Capri was historically known to have wealthier residents, while
							Anacapri was more of a farming community. It was a real example of the Montagues and Capulets, since
							there was real anamosity between Capri and AnaCapri. Their youth were discouraged from marrying each
							other, and Capri was known to lock their city gates at night to discourage such exchanges in the cover
							of night. It wasn't until Axel Munthe, a Swedish doctor, arrived in 1885 that AnaCapri and Capri began
							to solve their problems under his encouragement. Munthe's home in Anacapri, called the Villa San Michele
							is open for touring.</p>
