					<p>Amalfi Coast, Italy August 2014</p>
						<p><CENTER>I've done a fair bit of traveling abroad, and I've found that local stories tend to be the history of the poor. In many cases they are sad, and serve as a lesson.
						In Italy I took this picture, my friend Bartolo told me it marks the hall of a minor gentry.
						The husband died at a young age, and his wife was left with the property and wealth. She
						became attached to her steward and they began a romantic relationship that ended in a secret
						marriage. When the woman's brothers found out that she married without permission-and to her
						steward-they allegedly killed him and bricked her up in the tower to die. Bartolo said that
						there are many stories like that in Italy, ones of love and sadness. This picture was taken
						along the Amalfi Coast..</p>

						<p>According to him, the Italian Cypress has different meanings throughout Italy. In the Amalfi
						region, the Italian Cypress is usually planted around graveyards. It resembles the flame of a
						candle, burning for the dead. In northern Italy, the meaning of the Cypress is different. If
						 you look at the picture of the tower again, you can see the Cypress lining the avenue to the
						 tower...well the tops of the peaks at least. </CENTER> </p>
